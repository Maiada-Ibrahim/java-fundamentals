Project Name:java-fundamentals(pluralize ,Flipping Coins,Command Line Clock

)
Author: maiada ibrahim
Version: 1.0.0 

Overview : some problem need to solve
Pluralize
Write a function called pluralize that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

Flipping Coins
Write a function called flipNHeads that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row. once n heads have been in a row.

Command Line Clock
Write a method clock that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button in their IDE. Each time should only be printed once. Your program should detect when the seconds increase and only print something out when the timestamp changes.

Zero-pad single digit numbers as strings so the timestamp is always the same number of characters.

we add for the basiclibtary 

 ## [Maps](https://github.com/Maiada-Ibrahim/java-fundamentals/tree/main/basiclibrary1)
1. Analyzing Weather Data:

find the min and max values. Use a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterate from the min temp to the max temp and create a String containing any temperature not seen during the month. Return that String.

the user insert array of temperatures and this function return 
High: 72
Low: 51
Never saw temperature: 63
Never saw temperature: 67
Never saw temperature: 68
Never saw temperature: 69


2. Tallying Election:

Write a function called tally that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.
